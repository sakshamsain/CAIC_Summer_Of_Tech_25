# üõ©Ô∏è CAIC Summer of Tech (CSoT) ‚Äì Aerial Robotics
Organized by AeroClub, IIT Delhi

The Aerial Robotics problem statement is part of the CAIC Summer of Tech (CSoT) initiative aimed at introducing first-year students and beginners to the foundational concepts of drone technology and autonomous aerial systems. Emphasizing a simulation-first approach using Webots, an open-source robotics simulator, this five-week journey blends theory with hands-on programming in Python to simulate quadcopter behavior, control, and visual navigation.

Participants will gain core skills in:

- Multirotor physics and dynamics
- PID-based control systems
- Path planning and waypoint navigation
- Real-time computer vision for visual tracking
- Full mission simulation integrating flight and perception

This initiative builds a strong base for future involvement in AeroClub projects and competitions such as Inter-IIT Tech Meet 2025.

## üìÖ Weekly Breakdown & Objectives
### Week 1: Introduction to Drone Dynamics and Takeoff
- Understand multirotor basics: thrust, torque, degrees of freedom.

- Learn how quadcopters are modeled in Webots.

- Implement a Python controller for motor initialization and basic takeoff.

Deliverables: takeoff_controller.py, short demo video, README.

### Week 2: Autonomous Waypoint Navigation
- Build on Week 1 to implement waypoint-based navigation (e.g., square pattern).

- Use simple velocity commands (no PID yet) to move the drone in 2D.

- Tasks include defining waypoints, heading control, and safe landing.

Deliverables: waypoint_nav.py, simulation video, brief README.

### Week 3: PID-Based Altitude Control
- Introduce feedback control using a PID controller to maintain altitude.

- Tune PID gains and integrate sensor data (altimeter or position field).

- Understand concepts like oscillation, steady-state error, and overshoot.

Deliverables: pid_altitude.py, tuning explanation, plot of altitude over time.

### Week 4: Visual Navigation and Object Tracking
- Use Webots‚Äô simulated camera to detect a colored marker using OpenCV.

- Apply image processing (HSV thresholding, contour detection).

- Convert marker location into motion commands, enabling autonomous tracking.

- Maintain altitude using the PID controller from Week 3.

Deliverables:

vision_tracking.py with image processing pipeline, 
Demo video showing the drone tracking and centering on a marker, 
Updated README with algorithm description

### Week 5: Integrated Navigate & Inspect Mission
- Combine altitude hold, waypoint navigation, and marker inspection.

- Structure code into reusable modules (takeoff, nav, vision, landing).

- Use a mission_params.json to define altitude, waypoints, and HSV values.

Log performance in mission_log.csv (e.g., waypoint times, marker detections).

Deliverables:

inspect_mission.py, mission_params.json, and mission_log.csv, 
Demo video of complete mission (‚â§3 mins), 
README describing setup, logic, and sample results

## üéØ Outcome
By the end of the 5 weeks, participants will:

- Be comfortable with drone control theory and Webots simulation
- Understand real-time feedback systems like PID
- Implement and integrate OpenCV-based visual tracking
- Gain project experience simulating a mission-like autonomous flight

Whether you‚Äôre preparing for tech competitions or planning to join AeroClub‚Äôs core teams, this program sets a solid foundation in aerial robotics with an emphasis on both practical skills and structured coding.
